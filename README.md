# Richness-of-Species-Across-the-Landscape-of-UK---Statistical-Analysis

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing biodiversity measurements for a wide array of species across various regions in the United Kingdom. Using the R programming language, the project reveals intricate patterns, correlations, and significant insights from the data. The findings are presented through visually appealing presentations and detailed reports.

## Features

- **Data Analysis:**
  - Conducted thorough data exploration exercises to uncover intricate patterns and correlations.
  - Utilized univariate analysis and basic statistics to understand the distribution of species richness.

- **Visualization:**
  - Created visually appealing presentations using ggplot2 to enhance clarity and understanding.
  - Developed engaging visual narratives by integrating findings into HTML webpages and PDF documents using Rmarkdown.

- **Statistical Testing:**
  - Performed hypothesis testing, including Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and T-tests, to compare distributions and validate results.
  - Applied linear and multiple linear regression models to identify relationships between species richness and ecological variables.

## System Components

1. **Health Records Dataset:**
   - The dataset comprises measurements of biodiversity for various species across different locations in the UK.
   - Includes features such as species richness, ecological status, and environmental factors.
   - Provides a comprehensive source of data for analysis and model training.

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Conducted univariate analysis to calculate key statistics like mean, median, quartiles, and winsorized means.
   - Explored correlations between different species to identify significant associations.

3. **Visualization Tools:**
   - Used ggplot2 for creating detailed and informative visualizations.
   - Employed Rmarkdown to generate HTML and PDF reports, making the findings easily accessible and interpretable.

4. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Performed Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to compare distributions and assess normality.
   - Conducted T-tests to determine the significance of observed differences.
   - Applied contingency tables, likelihood ratios, and odds ratios to analyze categorical variables.
   - Utilized sensitivity, specificity, and Youden Index to evaluate diagnostic tests.

5. **Regression Models:**
   - Developed simple and multiple linear regression models to explore relationships between ecological variables and species richness.
   - Iteratively improved models by comparing AIC values and adjusted R-squared statistics.

## Outcome

The implementation of this project has yielded several positive outcomes:

- **Enhanced Understanding:** Gained significant insights into the distribution and correlation of species richness across different regions in the UK.
- **Effective Visualization:** Created clear and informative visualizations that effectively communicate complex data and findings.
